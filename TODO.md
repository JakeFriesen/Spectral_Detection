## TODO:
- [ ] User Interface (Jake)
    - [x] Upload your own model
    - [x] Choose image/video, transect/drop quadrat, confidence
    - [x] Manual selection of detections (check how intuitive this is)
    - [ ] Slider for video slicing
    - [x] Batch detection workflow
    - [x] Manual substrate classifier
- [ ] Functional UI Changes
    - [ ] Use form for sidebar toggles
    - [x] Add Substrate to table
    - [x] Add detection results path (no coverage)
    - [ ] Add a button to clear the image list
    - [ ] Stop stats recalculation after every click
