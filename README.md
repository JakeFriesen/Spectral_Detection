# ECE 499 Species Detection for Spectral Labs
## About
This needs a write up about the project


## TODO:
- [ ] User Interface
    - [ ] Upload your own model
    - [ ] Choose image/video, transect/drop quadrat, confidence
    - [ ] Manual selection of detections (check how intuitive this is)
    - [ ] Slider for video slicing
    - [ ] Batch detection workflow
    - [ ] Manual substrate classifier
- [ ] SAM Integration into website
- [ ] Video parsing function
    - [ ] Selectable frame sequence (transects)
    - [ ] Individual tracking after detection (transects)
    - [ ] Finding optimal frame (drop quadrat)
- [ ] Results
    - [ ] Area calculation inside pvc pipe
    - [ ] Diameter of urchins, stars?
    - [ ] Spreadsheet formatting
- [ ] Model
    - [ ] Better kelp model
    - [ ] More data from Romina (?) to make models better
    - [ ] Subclass model for sea stars
- [ ] Manual addition of detections
    - [ ] Using a python chart? Need to convert detection results 
    - [ ] Research required to determine feasibility
- [ ] Documentation
    - [ ] A lot of this, for everything
    - [ ] Add it to the GitHub: https://github.com/JakeFriesen/Spectral_Detection
    - [ ] Collect all data, and give it to Navneet after project is over
